# 💰 Personal Finance Manager (C Language)

A simple command-line based finance tracker built in C using doubly linked lists.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add new transactions with category and date
- 🧾 Display all saved transactions
- ✏️ Edit any transaction by amount, category, and date
- ❌ Delete specific transactions
- 💵 View total savings (sum of all transaction amounts)
- 📊 Calculate total income and total expenses separately

## 📂 Transaction Structure

Each transaction contains:
- `amount` - Integer value (positive for income, negative for expenses)
- `category` - Description or type of transaction (e.g., Salary, Rent)
- `date` - Date of transaction in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

## 🛠 How It Works

The program uses a **doubly linked list** to dynamically store and manage transactions in memory.

No external file storage is used — all data is lost upon exiting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

### ⚙️ Compilation

To compile the program, use:

```bash
gcc finance_manager.c -o finance_manager
